# STTAITTS

## AI Assistant written in Python.

The name is derived from: STT(SpeechToText from Google), AI(GPT-3-davinci from OpenAI) and TTS(TextToSpeech from Google). By combining these APIs, I basically created an Assistant like Siri and Google Assistant, which behaves more human and is also able to recognize Czech and answer in Czech. Whenever i get access to GPT-4, I am going to be switching to that.
