# STTAITTS

## AI Assistant written in Python.

The name is derived from: STT(SpeechToText from Google), AI(GPT-4 from OpenAI) and TTS(TextToSpeech from Google). By combining these APIs, I basically created an Assistant like Siri and Google Assistant, which behaves more human and is also able to recognize Czech and answer in Czech.

<!-- ## Usage

- Download the newest build.
- Unpack into a folder.
- Run the exe.
- Press ";" to start the speech recognition.
- Say: "Listen" or "Poslouchej" then wait for it to say "Ano?".
- Say whatever you want to it (in Czech). -->
